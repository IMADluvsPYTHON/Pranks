# Malwares
In this repository, I have created some python codes with which you can prank anyone. Just for fun!!

The first file which is [MouseControl.py](MouseControl.py) will make the mouse move

automatically. 

 You can change the time the mouse should move according to your wish in the file. 

 [Second file](Webbrowser.py) is he most dangerous of all. This wil start opening browser

windows until the system crashes or it's restarted. 

You can choose any link of your choice

 [Third file](weird_sounds.py) as the name says will produce weird sounds.


You can combine all these file to make a great malware.

If you stuck at any of these scripts Pres **CTRL +ALT + DELETE** and restart your PC

**FOR EDUCATION PURPOSE ONLY**
