# Malwares
In this repository, I have created some python codes with which you can prank your friends. Just for fun!!

The first file which is [MouseControl.py](MouseControl.py) will make the mouse move

automatically. \

 You can change the time according to your wish in the file. \

 [Second file](Webbrowser.py) is he most dangerous of all. This wil start opening browser

windows until the system crashes or it's restarted. \

 [Third file](weird_sounds.py) as the name says will produce weird sounds.



You can combine all these file to make a great malware.
