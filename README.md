# Malwares
In this repository, I have created some python codes with which you can prank anyone. Just for fun!!

First open the terminal and type:\
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

The first file which is [MouseControl.py](MouseControl.py) will make the mouse move
automatically. \
You can change the time the mouse should move according to your wish in the file.\

[Second file](Webbrowser.py) is the most dangerous of all. This wil start opening browser
windows until the system crashes or it's restarted. \
You can choose any link of your choice.\

 [Third file](weird_sounds.py) as the name says will produce weird sounds.\
 
Just run **python [name of the file.py]** to start any one file.

You can combine all these file to make a great malware.

If you stuck at any of these scripts Press **CTRL + ALT + DELETE** and restart your PC

**FOR EDUCATION PURPOSE ONLY**
